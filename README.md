# SnakeGame
This is a project I did for my University chapter of ACM Freshman year (before I knew how to really use github, and before I knew not to upload the compiled code)

It is a simple Snake game built on Processing that was included in an arcade cabinet that we built that runs on a Raspberry Pi.
